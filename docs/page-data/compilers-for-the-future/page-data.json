Now the semantics of the language were formless and empty, undefined declarations were over the face of the headers, and the <em>Cursor of the Developer</em> was hovering above the code on the screen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the <em>Developer</em> said: <strong>“Let there be types,”</strong> and there were types. The <em>Developer</em> saw that the types were good, and they separated the type-safe from the type-unsafe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A compiler author hits the enter key on their screen and their language implementation compiles and runs. The code is <em>flawless</em>. The compiler author is happy. The compiler author commits their changes like a responsible developer and goes home for the day.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Time ticks by and the Earth moves around the Sun.</strong></em></p>\n<p>The compiler author works on other projects for a time and later returns to their language after a few years. They find that: a dependency has been yanked, one of the libraries won’t compile without python2, and old compiled programs no longer run on the latest version of their OS. The compiler author is sad. The compiler author fixes the issues and commits their changes like a responsible developer and goes home for the day.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Time ticks by and the Earth moves around the Sun.</strong></em></p>\n<p>The compiler author is much older. The compiler author writes their philosophy regarding compiler design and semantics in a series of blog posts. While the compiler author is still alive, they are able to confess the <em>One True Way</em> to write programs idiomatically and what their compiler is <em>supposed</em> to do. A small community of users have gathered, and they rely on the compiler author’s implementation for their projects to work. The compiler author is happy. The compiler author commits their changes like a responsible developer and goes home for the day.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Time ticks by and the Earth moves around the Sun.</strong></em></p>\n<p>The compiler author is dead. The community for the language has slowly shrunk, and the only remnants of the dialect are a few programs used to check people’s tax returns for the next ~1000 years. The compiler author’s implementation of the language sits in a repository completely untouched over the ages. These files are the fossils of a language.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Time ticks by and the Earth moves around the Sun.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Decades have passed. Hardware has transformed. 64 bit code support is obsolete. Manufacturers are transitioning away from traditional x86 based assembly architectures and using the new McDonald’s “McLambda-Bitecode” CPU (I’m lovin’ it™) powered by the legendary STBLC (Simply-Typed-Binary-Lambda-Calculus) instruction set architecture.</p>\n<p>The compiler author’s language is not only dead, it is <em>buried</em>. The language is decomposing in its repository while time eats it up. To run any of the compiler author’s programs now, a new implementation of the language must be written from scratch. The fate of the language depends on how difficult it is to resuscitate the language from its grave.</p>\n<p><em>Will a machine ever sing a song in this tongue again?</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"an-immortal-language\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#an-immortal-language\" aria-label=\"an immortal language permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>An Immortal Language</h2>\n<p>A language is truly mortal when it is too difficult to resuscitate from the dead. Similarly, a language is immortal when it is easy to resuscitate from the dead.</p>\n<p>One example of an immortal language is BrainF*$!. A novice programmer can implement a BrainF^%@ compiler in a single sitting. Any program written in BrainF&#x26;~+ will be simple to support by a compiler written in any general purpose programming language in the future. BrainF!@# is immortal.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>BrainF%=” Instruction</th>\n<th>C Source Code Equivalent</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">></code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">++ptr;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">--ptr;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">+</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">++(*ptr);</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">-</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">--(*ptr);</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">.</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">putchar(*ptr);</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">,</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">*ptr = getchar();</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">[</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">while (*ptr) {</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">]</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">}</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This language is immortal because the <em>complexity</em> of the language is so minimal. The trade off in BrainF\\{&#x26; is that the complexity is shifted into the source code. The only way to simplify the source code is to take on more complexity in the language. This is the trade off of immortality. An immortal language must balance both the complexity required to implement the language and the complexity of source code required to implement any possible algorithm.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And a voice from heaven said, “This is my <em>Compiler</em>, whom I love; with it I am well pleased.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The goal of a compiler author is that their language live. Their language is the embodiment of their programming philosophy (or some subset of their philosophy) and a part of their legacy. The compiler author <em>ought</em> to balance the complexity of the language and the complexity of the source code so that their language is immortal. The compiler author <em>ought</em> to express their language with the smallest set of architecture dependent primitives necessary. If they do not, their language will be choked by the thorns and thistles and will eventually suffocate from the unnecessary effort required to port the language due to the extra complexity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The wages of complexity and unportability are obsolescence, but the free gift of simplicity is eternal support.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"writing-future-proof-compilers-a-proposed-architecture\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#writing-future-proof-compilers-a-proposed-architecture\" aria-label=\"writing future proof compilers a proposed architecture permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Writing Future-Proof Compilers (A Proposed Architecture)</h2>\n<p>BrainF*! is a simple language, but it is not a <em>useful</em> language. It is not useful for many reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s not expressive enough to simply represent the logic of real world problems.</li>\n<li>As a compiler target, it is not efficient. Addition is <code class=\"language-text\">O(N)</code>. For a language to be useful, it must <em>at least</em> be able to implement any algorithm in the smallest possible time complexity (and ideally space complexity, but this might be less important).</li>\n<li>It is <em>incomplete</em> for general purpose use. There is functionality that developers need that can’t be implemented in BrainF*!. For example, there is no way to compile a program that reads a file from disk, because there is no way to call foreign functions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Compiler authors want to write useful languages, so the language must be able to express the logic of real world problems. The language must be able to implement any algorithm in the smallest possible time complexity. The language must be able to call foreign functions. The language must be able to do all of this while being as simple as possible.</p>\n<p>What might a language look like that is simple, expressive, and efficient? What might a language look like that is <em>future-proof</em>?</p>\n<p>I propose the following architecture for a future-proof language: a Turing tape architecture with a register and a read/write head over the tape. The architecture is simple to understand, and a compiler for the instruction set could easily be implemented by a freshman computer science student. The architecture is flexible enough to represent real world problems efficiently, 1:1 with common programming constructs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#web-demo\"><em><strong>Click here to skip directly to the web-demo of the compiler.</strong></em></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"prelude\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#prelude\" aria-label=\"prelude permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Prelude</h3>\n<p>This prelude demonstrates the types of all the primitives necessary to implement this language.

With <code class=\"language-text\">Where?</code>, the VM can use either cell indices or real pointers to implement the tape without the compiler needing to know the difference.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/e8f449d36f28952854c184775521fe40/where.svg\" alt=\"Where?\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"deref-and-refer\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#deref-and-refer\" aria-label=\"deref and refer permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Deref and Refer</h4>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">Deref</code> instruction saves the current pointer to the “deref stack”, and <em>dereferences</em> the address stored at the pointer: <code class=\"language-text\">push(ptr); ptr = *ptr</code>.

Code using floating point instructions must use the standard instructions to do those operations. Almost all targets implement the standard instructions, but they are not required to do so. A bare metal target might not have floating point support, for example. Targets can support <em>some</em> of the standard instructions, but not all of them. For example, a target might support floats, but not have an allocator, so it can’t support <code class=\"language-text\">Alloc</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Free</code>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the standard instructions implement the <code class=\"language-text\">Peek</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Poke</code> instructions used for FFI.

It has parametric polymorphism⚗️, algebraic data types🧮, pattern matching🎯, and more. The language backend is simple enough that it can easily be ported to platforms like the web, but it’s also capable of implementing common algorithms like quicksort or real world algorithms like AES encryption and decryption (Rijndael). The compiler <em>could</em> be reimplemented in itself (with a <em>lot</em> of effort). The stages of compilation used to create the language are suitable intermediate representations for implementing other languages as well.</p>\n<p>This web-demo shows the compiler in action: you can change the output to see the generated IR, the psuedo-assembly, the instruction set code, the equivalent C source, the x86 assembly, and the execution output (the generated instructions are fed into an interpreter after compilation).</p>\n<h3 id=\"web-demo\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#web-demo\" aria-label=\"web demo permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Web-Demo</h3>\n<p><embed type=\"text/html\" src=\"https://adam-mcdaniel.github.io/sage/sage/web/index.html\" title=\"Compiler\" width=\"100%\" height=\"940em\"></embed></p>\n<p>You might worry that the architecture forces the language to compile to a verbose number of instructions, and that this leads to inefficiency despite being portable. Fear not: optimizations can be applied very aggressively to make the code highly performant. A compiler, for example, might implement first class Tensor objects which can be compiled using the simple architectures instructions. An optimizing compiler can discern a matrix multiplication <em>very easily</em> just using peephole optimizations on the compiled instructions, and the optimizer can substitute those operations with the equivalent BLAS library calls. This allows programs to be <em>compiled for portability</em> for distribution (write once run anywhere, <em>and</em> add a new supported platform in an afternoon), but then it also allows programs to utilize <em>optimized platform specific code upon execution / lowering to a given target</em>.</p>\n<p>I plan to create a frontend language with traits and classes on top of this representation, and to create a statically checked foreign function interface model for the language to allow users to implement hooks for LibC with a simple TOML file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Wow, now I can compile high level programs using polymorphism and algebraic types down to an architecture that can essentially be assembled for your favorite target with string replacement and a little bit of duct tape! Compiled programs which use this architecture are <em>at least</em> guaranteed to be simple to resurrect: <em>some</em> degree of immortality. This architecture will survive as long as there are machines with imperative instruction sets, and probably as long as Turing-complete general-purpose-languages that have integers and array-like data structures.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Time ticks by and the Earth moves around the Sun.</strong></em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2023-08-06---Compilers-For-The-Future/compilers-for-the-future","tagSlugs":["/tag/compilers/","/tag/opinion/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2023-06-08T11:52:37.121Z","description":"How can we future-proof our programming languages?","tags":["Compilers","Opinion"],"title":"Compilers For The Future","socialImage":"/media/lisp.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2023-08-06---Compilers-For-The-Future/compilers-for-the-future"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","2764776372","401334301"]}
