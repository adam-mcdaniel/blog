The reason I’m so excited about implementing them is because of this concept of <strong><em>combinators</em></strong>. Combinators are basically primitive lambda functions that are really simple but very powerful. There’s something <strong><em>REALLY</em></strong> special about combinators though. Any lambda expression that can be written, no matter how complex, can be rewritten as applications of a <strong>single</strong> combinator. This means that any lambda calculus program can be compiled to a giant expression of single function calls which are really easy to interpret. You dont even need to write a crazy implementation of beta reduction seen below!</p>\n<p><a href=\"blog/media/beta_reduction.png\">Beta Reduction</a></p>\n<p>The most powerful part about combinator compilers, in my opinion, is the fact that their intermediate code is so portable. Combinator interpreters are so easy to write in any turing machine or lambda calculus based language. Compilers are a bit more complex, but still simple.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem with combinator compilers is that they’re slow. There is a way to mitigate this issue, though. The more combinators that the intermediate representation has, the faster the output code!</p>\n<p>I’m working on a new language implementing this compiler architecture, I can’t wait to see how it goes! I’ll keep updating this blog with my progress after my school work eases up.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/combinator-compilers","tagSlugs":["/tag/functional-programming/","/tag/lambda-calculus/","/tag/turing-tarpit/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-04-03T11:52:37.121Z","description":"A brief exploration of combinator compilers","tags":["Functional Programming","Lambda Calculus","Turing Tarpit"],"title":"Combinator Compilers","socialImage":"blog/media/combinator.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/combinator-compilers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
