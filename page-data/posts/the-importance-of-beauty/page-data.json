If you can’t display your product to your users in an appealing way, their attention will be drawn to more visually appealing alternatives.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/media/design.png\" alt=\"Design\"></p>\n<p>When I build an application, I’m always sure to make the presentation as good as possible before launch. Take, for example, <a href=\"https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/oakc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Oak</a> (yes, I know I’m going crazy with posts about this project). Before I posted the project <em>anywhere</em>, I made sure I had an extensive README page with lots of pictures, tables, and formatted text to make reading easier on the eyes. The <strong><em>first thing the reader sees is a nice looking image of example code</em></strong>. While Oak’s features speak for themselves, I don’t think the code is responsible for the project’s success. <strong>The key was the presentation</strong>. Similarly, I’ve found that other projects that <em>don’t</em> use flashy presentations, don’t get nearly the attention they deserve. Take <a href=\"https://github.com/davidberneda/Vidi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vidi</a>, for example. This project is <em>crazy</em> good for a new language made by one person. Not only did he implement a really good looking language, he made an IDE to make development easier.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/media/vidi.png\" alt=\"Vidi\"></p>\n<p>However, after a launch on Reddit, the project only got <em><strong>2 stars on GitHub</strong></em>. How is that even possible? The answer is <em>the README isn’t flashy enough</em>. His README consisted of a single image, and two links. That’s it. There’s nothing for the reader to get attached to or excited about.</p>\n<p>A project truly suffers without a good README or website. The best way to draw interest <em>isn’t</em> to make a great product. It’s to make a <em>GOOD</em> (at least) product <em>AND</em> to make a great first impression.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/the-importance-of-beauty","tagSlugs":["/tag/beauty/","/tag/ux/","/tag/design/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-08-10T11:52:37.121Z","description":"While the practical aspect of an application is incredibly important, I believe that the presentation is significantly more important.","tags":["Beauty","UX","Design"],"title":"The Importance of Beauty","socialImage":"/blog/media/design.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/the-importance-of-beauty"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
