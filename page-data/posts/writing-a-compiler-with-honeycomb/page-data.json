Im super proud of that fact :)</p>\n<p>To test honeycomb’s capabilities, I started work on a simple compiler for an object oriented and functional programming language. Within a three or so hours of work, the compiler was fully implemented! This was a huge surprise to me because working with Lark-Parser in Python would take a full days work.</p>\n<p>The you can find the language <a href=\"https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/honeycomb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s dynamically typed, and is compiled to a custom 10 instruction set virtual machine code implemented in Rust. After compiling my language to Rust, the output Rust code can then be lowered to native executable code!</p>\n<p>Although this was just a test, I am VERY interested in writing a compiled scripting language that acts as a cross platform version of Bash. I’ve drawn a lot of my inspiration from Groovy, which is a language commonly used as a more robust replacement for shell scripts. I think a cross platform scripting language and shell would be a wonderful advancement in programming technology, and I can’t wait to investigate this topic further.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/writing-a-compiler-with-honeycomb","tagSlugs":["/tag/parsing/","/tag/compilers/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-01-09T01:35:32.169Z","description":"After reading about parser combinator libraries, I started to write my own!
